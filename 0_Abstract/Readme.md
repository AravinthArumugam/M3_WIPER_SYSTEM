## WIPER SYSTEM 

The LED frequency and time are used to control the Stimulated Wiper System. The wiper motor is replaced with an LED. For each wiper motor speed, a different colour blinks. This RED LED blinks slowly because it is used for a very slow wipe. The GREEN LED is used as a medium-speed wipe; it blinks faster than the RED LED. The ORANGE LED is then used as a fast wipe, and it blinks faster than the GREEN LED.
